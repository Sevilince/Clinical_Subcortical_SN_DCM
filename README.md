## Clinical_Subcortical_SN_DCM

#DCM

The display_modulatory_results_and_LOOC_clinical.m script will reproduce the DCM and LOOCV results for modulatory parameters reported in the Ince et al., manuscript. 

The display_endogenous_results_and_LOOC_clinical.m script will reproduce the DCM and LOOCV results for endogenous parameters reported in the Ince et al., manuscript. 

Each script contains a detailed description of the outputs.


#GLM

'Group_level_GLM_NEG_NEU' folder contains the group-level GLM results for the negative emotional salience (NEG>NEU contrast) in Ince et al. manuscript. This folder also 
contains the thresholded NEG>NEU t map (at voxel-wise pFDR < .05, KE ≥ 10) as illustrated in Figure 1C.


#Masks
